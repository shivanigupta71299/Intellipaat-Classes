       "25509   I was so shocked to find out that almost all gums have BHT.  I went to the health food store and got gum with Xylitol but I didn't like the taste.  B Fresh was the only one with Xylitol that didn't taste like aspartame.  I saw Newmans Own Organic Mints and was happy to see no aspartame or BHT and they are really good.  I hope the company starts making gum.  The only problem is the mints are made in Mexico.  What is the matter Americans can't make mints?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

The women who answered wasn't helpful and didn't know why. She also seemed annoyed with my question.  I won't even give my dog food with BHT why would I feed my family a cereal with BHT.  Why don't these company use the more natural and safer preservative like tocoperol etc?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "106550  You cannot find this in the stores anymore, it's impossible to find.  The price sometimes can be ridiculous ranging up above $40 (REALLY!).  I orderd this on the subscribe and save under $18, but if the price increased, will discountinue it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "431598  WARNING:  I use to feed my dogs Orijen 75% protein but the last few months my dogs have had really bad diarrhea.  We thought one would need IV fluids because he was getting dehydrated.  I looked at the bag and saw they now changed to 80% protein and now use sodium selenite which I would never buy a food with this ingredient.  Instead of getting better they are getting worse.  80% protein is a lot for a non working dog. And now with the recall, I have to look for another brand of dog food with selenium yeast, no ethoxyquin, no BHT etc. Also, the company that once was great in customer service now refuses to answer e-mail questions.  What are they hiding.  This use to be a good quality dog food that I use to recommend to everyone.  When I returned the 80% protein bag back the girl said a lot of people have been complaining and they aren't recommending this brand anymore.   \n",
